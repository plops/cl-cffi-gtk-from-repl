Tutorial for GTK+ development with cl-cffi-gtk and SLIME in emacs.

gtk-from-repl.lisp .. I describe my workflow and published this as a blog article on http://fourierlisp.blogspot.de/

custom-widget.c, makefile .. This is to learn how to extend gobject classes using C.
                             I copied most of the code from the cited source but used gcc's lambda functions at some point.
			     Now I realize that GTK programs for C need enormous amounts of boiler plate.


custom-widget.asd
package.lisp
gtk-grovel.lisp      .. In order to register new classes with gobject I have to know the size of parent classes (which cl-cffi-gtk doesn't know) 
custom-class.lisp
test.lisp            .. load the custom-widget package. I try to get to the point where I can define gobject classes from lisp.
