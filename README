Tutorial for GTK+ development with cl-cffi-gtk and SLIME in emacs.

Originally this repository started as one file gtk-from-repl.lisp but
now it contains several more pieces of code which need to be
documented eventually.

gtk-from-repl.lisp .. I describe my workflow and published this as a blog article on http://fourierlisp.blogspot.de/. If you want to do what is described in the Blog post, just load this file.

custom-widget.c, makefile .. This is to learn how to extend gobject classes using C.
                             I copied most of the code from the cited source but used gcc's lambda functions at some point.
			     Now I realize that GTK programs for C need enormous amounts of boiler plate.


custom-widget.asd
package.lisp
gtk-grovel.lisp      .. In order to register new classes with gobject I have to know the size of parent classes (which cl-cffi-gtk doesn't know) 
custom-class.lisp
test.lisp            .. load the custom-widget package. I can now define a new widget (to enter an ip-address) using Common Lisp (but the lisp must support cffi:defcallback)

custom-cell-render.lisp .. This is my second attempt to extend GTK. This time I'm trying to define a cell renderer that displays a progress bar. This is a port of some C tutorial.


What is my goal?

Eventually, I want to have a very responsive GUI. In particular a tree view with numbers that can be changed with minimal mouse clicks.
